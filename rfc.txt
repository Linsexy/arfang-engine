1.  Overview

   R-Type is a side scrolling shoot-em-up arcade game produced by Irem
   in 1987.  The player controls a space fighter named the R-9 to defend
   humanity against a mysterious powerful alien life-form known as the
   "Bydo".

   Being one of Irem's most well-known video games, R-Type was ported to
   various home platforms, and several of its versions including the
   arcade original have since been re-released on more contemporary
   consoles.  Both the arcade game and the ports were well received by
   video game magazines.  It has spawned a series of sequels by Irem and
   inspired several video games from other companies.
